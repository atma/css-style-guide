# CSS Style Guide

MercadoLibre CSS Style Guide.

## Intro
The main goal of this guide is to set standards for writing our CSS files and modules, helping the readability and maintainability of our code. By doing this, we can significantly reduce the time required to understand any front-end implementation.

By writing clean code, we are able to:

- achieve a code thatâ€™s easier to understand;
- detect errors and potential problems;
- easily identify what code can be reused;
- build or update any functionality on any code already implemented;
- work on any file regardless of who wrote it.

> "Consistent code, even when written by a team, should look like one person wrote it."
